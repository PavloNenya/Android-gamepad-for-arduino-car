# Android-gamepad-for-arduino-car

This is simple android app that I created in summer 2022 for my arduino-project. It is used for remote control via Bluetooth. 
I do not try to figure out how properly construct mobile app and it's architecture or developmemt cycle, so this is a kind of poor quality work
